  üîí CRITICAL SECURITY FIX - Session Hijacking Vulnerability Patched
================================================================================

VERSION: 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1
DATE: October 29, 2025
STATUS: ‚úÖ FIXED & COMPILED

================================================================================
THE PROBLEM (v1.0.0 - VULNERABLE)
================================================================================

Player "Dream" online ‚Üí Attacker joins as "Dream" ‚Üí Original Dream kicked
Result: COMPLETE AUTHENTICATION BYPASS

This allowed attackers to:
  ‚ùå Kick legitimate players by joining with their username
  ‚ùå Bypass all authentication (password, PIN, everything)
  ‚ùå Take over player sessions
  ‚ùå Impersonate players on cracked servers

================================================================================
THE FIX (v1.0.1 - SECURE)
================================================================================

NEW FEATURE: Pre-Login Username Blocker
  ‚úÖ Checks username BEFORE player joins
  ‚úÖ Blocks attacker BEFORE original player is affected
  ‚úÖ Original player stays connected (doesn't even notice)
  ‚úÖ Comprehensive notifications and logging

HOW IT WORKS:
  1. Player "Dream" joins ‚Üí Username "Dream" registered in tracking system
  2. Attacker tries to join as "Dream" ‚Üí Pre-login check detects duplicate
  3. Attacker BLOCKED immediately with detailed message
  4. Original "Dream" gets security alert but stays connected
  5. Admins notified, Discord webhook sent, full audit trail

================================================================================
