# PIN Code System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Successfully Implemented

The PIN Code System has been fully integrated into the MBTH Login Security plugin, adding an additional layer of two-factor authentication.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Core Java Implementation (`MBTHLoginSecurity.java`)

#### New Data Structures
- `Map<UUID, Boolean> pinVerified` - Tracks PIN verification status
- `Map<UUID, Integer> pinAttempts` - Tracks failed PIN attempts
- `Set<UUID> playersWithPin` - Stores players who have set up PINs

#### New Configuration Variables
- `boolean pinEnabled` - Master switch for PIN system
- `boolean pinRequired` - Whether PINs are mandatory
- `int pinLength` - Number of digits required
- `int maxPinAttempts` - Max failed attempts before kick

#### New Player Commands
1. **`/setuppin <pin> <confirm>`** - Create a new PIN
   - Aliases: `/setpin`, `/createpin`
   - Validates PIN length and format
   - Stores hashed PIN securely

2. **`/verifypin <pin>`** - Verify PIN after login
   - Aliases: `/pin`, `/enterpin`
   - Tracks failed attempts
   - Kicks after max attempts exceeded

3. **`/changepin <old> <new> <confirm>`** - Change existing PIN
   - Alias: `/modifypin`
   - Requires current PIN verification
   - Updates timestamp

4. **`/removepin <current-pin>`** - Remove PIN (if not required)
   - Alias: `/deletepin`
   - Only works if PIN not required server-wide
   - Clears PIN data

#### New Admin Command
5. **`/resetpin <player>`** - Admin PIN reset
   - Alias: `/pinreset`
   - Requires `mbth.admin` permission
   - Can be used from console
   - Logs action for audit trail

#### Enhanced Security Checks
- Updated all event handlers to check `isFullyAuthenticated()` instead of just `isAuthenticated()`
- Movement, chat, damage, inventory, and interactions blocked until PIN verified
- Commands restricted during PIN verification phase
- Only `/verifypin` and `/setuppin` allowed when waiting for PIN

#### New Helper Methods
- `hasPin(UUID)` - Check if player has PIN
- `isPinVerified(Player)` - Check if PIN is verified
- `isFullyAuthenticated(Player)` - Password AND PIN verified
- `isValidPin(String)` - Validate PIN format
- `sendPinPrompt(Player)` - Display PIN entry screen
- `sendPinSetupPrompt(Player)` - Display PIN setup screen

### 2. Configuration (`config.yml`)

Added new configuration section:
```yaml
pin-code:
  enabled: true
  required: false
  length: 4
  max-attempts: 3
```

Added new messages:
```yaml
messages:
  pin-prompt: "&eEnter your PIN with &a/verifypin <pin>"
  pin-setup-prompt: "&eSetup your PIN with &a/setuppin <pin> <confirm>"
  pin-verified: "&aPin verified successfully!"
  incorrect-pin: "&cIncorrect PIN!"
```

### 3. Plugin Metadata (`plugin.yml`)

Registered 5 new commands with descriptions, usage, and aliases:
- setuppin
- verifypin
- changepin
- removepin
- resetpin (admin)

### 4. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation files:
- **`PIN_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md`** - Complete user and admin guide
- **`PIN_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** - This file

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **SHA-256 Hashing**: All PINs are hashed before storage
2. **Attempt Limiting**: Configurable max attempts before kick
3. **Numeric Only**: Only digits allowed, validated client-side
4. **Full Lockdown**: No player actions until PIN verified
5. **Audit Trail**: All PIN changes/resets are logged with timestamps
6. **Session Isolation**: PIN state cleared on disconnect

## 📊 Data Storage

PINs are stored in `plugins/MBTHLoginSecurity/players.yml`:

```yaml
players:
  <player-uuid>:
    password: <hashed-password>
    pin: <hashed-pin>
    pin-setup-date: <timestamp>
    pin-changed-date: <timestamp>
    pin-removed-date: <timestamp>
    pin-reset-by: <admin-name>
    pin-reset-date: <timestamp>
```

  length: 6         # 6-digit PIN
  max-attempts: 3   # 3 strikes and you're out
```

### Balanced Security
```yaml
pin-code:
  enabled: true
  required: false   # Optional PIN
  length: 4         # Standard 4-digit
  max-attempts: 5   # More lenient
```

### Disabled
```yaml
pin-code:
  enabled: false    # Traditional password-only
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Build the plugin**: `mvn clean package`
2. **Copy JAR**: From `target/` to server `plugins/` folder
3. **Restart server**: Load new configuration
4. **Test**: Create test account and try PIN system
5. **Configure**: Adjust settings in `config.yml` as needed
6. **Announce**: Inform players about new PIN feature

## 📌 Important Notes

- **Non-Breaking**: Existing accounts work without PINs (if not required)
- **Migration**: No data migration needed, works with existing player data
- **Compatibility**: Works with all existing features (sessions, alt detection, etc.)
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead, uses efficient data structures
- **Security**: Same SHA-256 hashing as passwords
