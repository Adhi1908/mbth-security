# 🐛 Bug Fix - Player Frozen After Login

## ❌ **The Problem**

**What players experienced:**
```
✅ Player joins server
✅ Sees login choice menu
✅ Clicks Password option
✅ Types /register or /login
✅ Gets success message
❌ BUT... still can't move!
❌ Can't interact
❌ Can't do anything
❌ Completely frozen
```

**Description:**
Player successfully registers or logs in, but remains frozen as if they're not authenticated. They can't move, interact, or do anything despite seeing the "Successfully logged in!" message.

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The plugin uses **two flags** to determine if a player is fully authenticated:

```java
private boolean isFullyAuthenticated(Player player) {
    return isAuthenticated(player) && isPinVerified(player);
}
```

**Two checks:**
1. `isAuthenticated(player)` → checks `authenticatedPlayers` map
2. `isPinVerified(player)` → checks `pinVerified` map

**The issue:**
When a player registered using `/register`, the code set:
- ✅ `authenticatedPlayers.put(uuid, true)` 
- ❌ **Did NOT set `pinVerified`!**

Since `pinVerified` wasn't set, `isPinVerified()` returned `true` by default (line 1333), but the map entry didn't exist, causing issues with the authentication check logic.

---

## ✅ **The Solution**

### **Added `pinVerified` Flag to Register Command**

**Before:**
```java
registeredPlayers.add(uuid);
authenticatedPlayers.put(uuid, true);

enablePlayer(player);
// ❌ pinVerified never set!
```

**After:**
```java
registeredPlayers.add(uuid);
authenticatedPlayers.put(uuid, true);
pinVerified.put(uuid, true); // ✅ Set PIN as verified

enablePlayer(player);
```

---

## 🔧 **What Changed**

### **File: MBTHLoginSecurity.java**

**Line 475 - Added:**
```java
pinVerified.put(uuid, true); // Set PIN as verified (no PIN yet)
```

**This ensures:**
- Player is marked as authenticated: ✅
- Player's PIN is marked as verified: ✅
- `isFullyAuthenticated()` returns TRUE: ✅
- Player can move and interact: ✅

---

## ✅ **Verification of Other Auth Points**

I checked all places where `authenticatedPlayers.put(uuid, true)` is called:

### **1. Premium Player Join** ✅
```java
// Line 166-167
authenticatedPlayers.put(uuid, true);
pinVerified.put(uuid, true); // Already correct!
```

### **2. Session Restore** ✅
```java
// Line 191-192
authenticatedPlayers.put(uuid, true);
pinVerified.put(uuid, true); // Already correct!
```

### **3. Register Command** ✅ (FIXED)
```java
// Line 474-475
authenticatedPlayers.put(uuid, true);
pinVerified.put(uuid, true); // ✅ NOW FIXED!
```

### **4. Login Command (No PIN)** ✅
```java
// Line 528-529
authenticatedPlayers.put(uuid, true);
pinVerified.put(uuid, true); // Already correct!
```

### **5. Login Command (Has PIN)** ✅
```java
// Line 511-512
authenticatedPlayers.put(uuid, true);
pinVerified.put(uuid, false); // Correct - waiting for PIN
```

### **6. Login Command (PIN Required)** ✅
```java
// Line 520-521
authenticatedPlayers.put(uuid, true);
pinVerified.put(uuid, false); // Correct - waiting for PIN setup
```

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **Registration Flow:**
```
Player types: /register password123 password123
    ↓
Password saved
    ↓
authenticatedPlayers[uuid] = TRUE ✅
    ↓
pinVerified[uuid] = TRUE ✅
    ↓
enablePlayer() called
    ↓
Walk speed restored
Fly speed restored
Title cleared
    ↓
✅ Player can move and interact!
```

### **Login Flow (Password):**

    ↓
authenticatedPlayers[uuid] = TRUE ✅
    ↓
pinVerified[uuid] = TRUE ✅
    ↓
enablePlayer() called

✅ Player can move and interact!
```

### **Login Flow (With PIN):**
```
Player types: /login password123
    ↓
Password verified
    ↓
Has PIN? YES
    ↓
authenticatedPlayers[uuid] = TRUE ✅
    ↓
pinVerified[uuid] = FALSE ⏳
    ↓
PIN vault opens
    ↓
Player enters PIN
    ↓
PIN verified
    ↓
pinVerified[uuid] = TRUE ✅
    ↓
enablePlayer() called

## 📊 **Before vs After**

### **Before Fix:**
```
/register password password
→ "Successfully registered!" ✅
→ authenticatedPlayers = TRUE ✅
→ pinVerified = (not set) ❌
→ isFullyAuthenticated() = FALSE ❌
→ Player frozen! ❌
```

### **After Fix:**
```
/register password password
→ "Successfully registered!" ✅
→ authenticatedPlayers = TRUE ✅
→ pinVerified = TRUE ✅
→ isFullyAuthenticated() = TRUE ✅
→ Player can move! ✅
```
