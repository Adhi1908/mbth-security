# üîç Debug Version - Find Why Player is Frozen

## üì¶ What I Added

I've compiled a **DEBUG VERSION** of the plugin that will show us EXACTLY what's happening when a player logs in.

---

## üöÄ How to Test

### **Step 1: Install Debug Version**
```
1. Stop your server
2. Replace plugin with: target/MBTHLoginSecurity-1.0.0.jar
3. Start server
```

### **Step 2: Try to Login**
```
1. Join server as cracked player
2. You'll see login choice menu
3. Click "Login with Password" (or PIN if you have one)
4. Type: /login yourpassword (or /register if new)
5. Try to move
```

### **Step 3: Check The Logs**
Look in your console/logs for these messages:

**After successful login/register, you should see:**
```
[INFO] Player YourName logged in successfully
[INFO]   authenticatedPlayers: true
[INFO]   pinVerified: true
[INFO]   isAuthenticated: true
[INFO]   isPinVerified: true
[INFO]   isFullyAuthenticated: true
```

**If you try to move and it's blocked, you'll see:**
```
[WARN] Movement blocked for YourName - Auth:true PinVerified:true FullyAuth:true
```
OR
```
[WARN] Movement blocked for YourName - Auth:false PinVerified:true FullyAuth:false
```
OR
```
[WARN] Movement blocked for YourName - Auth:true PinVerified:false FullyAuth:false
```

**You'll also see in chat:**
```
‚úî Successfully logged in!
Welcome back to MBTH!
Debug: Authenticated=true PinVerified=true FullyAuth=true
```

## üìã What to Send Me

**Please send me:**

1. **The login success message from console:**
   ```
   [INFO] Player YourName logged in successfully
   [INFO]   authenticatedPlayers: ???
   [INFO]   pinVerified: ???
   [INFO]   isAuthenticated: ???
   [INFO]   isPinVerified: ???
   [INFO]   isFullyAuthenticated: ???
   ```

2. **The movement blocked message (if you see it):**
   ```
   [WARN] Movement blocked for YourName - Auth:??? PinVerified:??? FullyAuth:???
   ```

3. **The debug message you see in chat:**
   ```
   Debug: Authenticated=??? PinVerified=??? FullyAuth=???
   ```

4. **What you tested:**
   - Did you use /register or /login?
   - Did you choose PIN or Password from menu?
   - Can you move? (yes/no)
   - Can you interact? (yes/no)

## üéØ What We're Looking For

### **If everything shows TRUE but still frozen:**
```
authenticatedPlayers: true
pinVerified: true
isAuthenticated: true
isPinVerified: true
isFullyAuthenticated: true
BUT... still can't move!
```
‚Üí Then the problem is somewhere ELSE (maybe another plugin?)

### **If something shows FALSE:**
```
authenticatedPlayers: false  ‚Üê Problem here!
OR
pinVerified: false  ‚Üê Problem here!
OR
isFullyAuthenticated: false  ‚Üê Problem here!
```
‚Üí Then we know exactly what's not being set correctly

### **If you don't see the login message at all:**
‚Üí The command isn't running (maybe typo?)

---

## üí° Quick Checks

**Before testing, verify:**

1. ‚úÖ You're using the NEW jar from `target/` folder
2. ‚úÖ Server restarted after replacing
3. ‚úÖ You're joining as CRACKED player (not premium)
4. ‚úÖ No other security plugins interfering

---

## üîß Common Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: All TRUE but frozen**
```
[INFO] isFullyAuthenticated: true
[WARN] Movement blocked - FullyAuth:true
```
**Meaning:** Something is wrong with the check logic or another plugin

### **Scenario 2: authenticatedPlayers FALSE**
```
[INFO] authenticatedPlayers: false
[INFO] isFullyAuthenticated: false
```
**Meaning:** Login command didn't set the flag

### **Scenario 3: pinVerified FALSE**
```
[INFO] pinVerified: false
[INFO] isFullyAuthenticated: false
```
**Meaning:** PIN flag not being set (our earlier fix didn't work)

### **Scenario 4: No debug messages**
```
(nothing in logs)
```
**Meaning:** Login command isn't being executed

## üì∏ Example Output

**Good output (should work):**
```
[16:00:00 INFO]: Player Steve logged in successfully
[16:00:00 INFO]:   authenticatedPlayers: true
[16:00:00 INFO]:   pinVerified: true
[16:00:00 INFO]:   isAuthenticated: true
[16:00:00 INFO]:   isPinVerified: true
[16:00:00 INFO]:   isFullyAuthenticated: true

In chat:
‚úî Successfully logged in!
Welcome back to MBTH!
Debug: Authenticated=true PinVerified=true FullyAuth=true

Player can move: YES ‚úÖ
```

**Bad output (won't work):**
```
[16:00:00 INFO]: Player Steve logged in successfully
[16:00:00 INFO]:   authenticatedPlayers: true
[16:00:00 INFO]:   pinVerified: false  ‚Üê PROBLEM!
[16:00:00 INFO]:   isAuthenticated: true
[16:00:00 INFO]:   isPinVerified: false  ‚Üê PROBLEM!
[16:00:00 INFO]:   isFullyAuthenticated: false  ‚Üê PROBLEM!

[16:00:01 WARN]: Movement blocked for Steve - Auth:true PinVerified:false FullyAuth:false

In chat:
‚úî Successfully logged in!
Welcome back to MBTH!
Debug: Authenticated=true PinVerified=false FullyAuth=false

Player can move: NO ‚ùå
```

## üìû Next Steps

**Once you send me the debug output, I can:**

1. ‚úÖ See EXACTLY what's false
2. ‚úÖ Know EXACTLY where the problem is
3. ‚úÖ Fix it with precision
4. ‚úÖ Remove debug messages
5. ‚úÖ Give you final working version

---

**Please test and send me the console output! üîç**

The debug messages will tell us exactly what's wrong.
