# 🐛 Bug Fix - Inventory Loop Glitch

## ❌ **The Problem**

**What was happening:**
- When player clicked an item in the login choice menu
- The inventory closed (normal behavior)
- The `onInventoryClose` event detected the close
- Thought player closed without selecting
- Reopened the menu immediately
- This created an infinite loop
- Player couldn't do anything - stuck in reopen loop

**Visual representation:**
```
Player clicks item → Menu closes → Event detects close → 
Reopens menu → Menu closes again → Event detects close → 
Reopens menu → Menu closes again → ... INFINITE LOOP!
```

## ✅ **The Solution**

### **Added Choice Tracking System**

**New tracking flag:**
```java
private final Set<UUID> loginChoiceMade = new HashSet<>();
```

This tracks which players have made a valid selection.

### **How It Works:**

**1. When player clicks an option:**
```java
if (clicked.getType() == Material.IRON_DOOR) {
    loginChoiceMade.add(uuid); // ✅ Mark choice as made
    player.closeInventory();
    // ... proceed with PIN
}
```

**2. When inventory closes:**
```java
if (title.contains("Choose Login Method")) {
    // Only reopen if NO choice was made
    if (!loginChoiceMade.contains(uuid)) {
        // Reopen after delay
    }
    return;
}
```

**3. When menu opens:**
```java
private void sendLoginMethodChoice(Player player) {
    loginChoiceMade.remove(uuid); // ✅ Clear flag for fresh start
    // ... open menu
}
```

**4. When player quits:**
```java
loginChoiceMade.remove(uuid); // ✅ Clean up
```

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### **1. Added Tracking Flag**
```java
// Line 50
private final Set<UUID> loginChoiceMade = new HashSet<>();
```

### **2. Updated Click Handler**
```java
// Lines 1492, 1512
loginChoiceMade.add(uuid); // Mark when choice is made
```

### **3. Updated Close Handler**
```java
// Line 382
if (!loginChoiceMade.contains(uuid) && ...) {
    // Only reopen if no choice made
}
```

### **4. Clear Flag on Menu Open**
```java
// Line 1424
loginChoiceMade.remove(uuid); // Reset for new menu
```

### **5. Clean Up on Quit**
```java
// Line 297
loginChoiceMade.remove(uuid);
```

### **6. Increased Delays**
```java
// Lines 391, 410
.runTaskLater(this, 10L); // Changed from 1L to 10L
```

## 🎯 **How It Fixes The Problem**

### **Before Fix:**
```
Menu Opens
    ↓
Player Clicks Item
    ↓
Menu Closes (by click handler)
    ↓
Close Event Fires
    ↓
❌ No tracking → Assumes accidental close
    ↓
Reopens Menu (after 1 tick)
    ↓
Menu Closes (by reopen)
    ↓
Close Event Fires Again
    ↓
❌ Infinite Loop!
```

### **After Fix:**
```
Menu Opens
    ↓
loginChoiceMade.remove(uuid) ← Clear flag
    ↓
Player Clicks Item
    ↓
loginChoiceMade.add(uuid) ← Mark choice made
    ↓
Menu Closes (by click handler)
    ↓
Close Event Fires
    ↓
✅ Check: loginChoiceMade.contains(uuid) → TRUE
    ↓
✅ Don't reopen - player made a choice!
    ↓
Proceed normally
```

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Player Clicks PIN**
```
✅ Menu opens
✅ Player clicks Iron Door
✅ Choice marked as made
✅ Menu closes
✅ Close event checks flag
✅ Flag exists - no reopen
✅ PIN vault opens normally
```

### **Scenario 2: Player Clicks Password**
```
✅ Menu opens
✅ Player clicks Paper
✅ Choice marked as made
✅ Menu closes
✅ Close event checks flag
✅ Flag exists - no reopen
✅ Login prompt shows normally
```

### **Scenario 3: Player Tries to Close Without Selecting**
```
✅ Menu opens
✅ Player presses Escape
✅ NO choice marked
✅ Menu closes
✅ Close event checks flag
✅ Flag doesn't exist - reopen!
✅ Menu reopens after 10 ticks (0.5s)
```

## 📊 **Improvements Made**

### **1. Choice Tracking**
- ✅ Tracks when valid selection is made
- ✅ Prevents reopen after intentional close
- ✅ Still reopens if player tries to escape

### **2. Increased Delays**
- ✅ Changed from 1 tick to 10 ticks (0.5 seconds)
- ✅ Prevents instant reopen feeling glitchy
- ✅ Gives smoother transition

### **3. Proper Cleanup**
- ✅ Clears flag when menu opens
- ✅ Clears flag when player quits
- ✅ No memory leaks

### **4. Better Logic**
- ✅ Only reopens if truly accidental
- ✅ Respects player choice
- ✅ Natural flow

## 🎮 **Player Experience**

### **Before Fix:**
