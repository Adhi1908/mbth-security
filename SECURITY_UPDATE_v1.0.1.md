# üîí CRITICAL SECURITY UPDATE - Version 1.0.1

## ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT: Session Hijacking Vulnerability Fixed

**Release Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Complete authentication bypass  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED in v1.0.1

---

## üö® What Was the Problem?

A critical vulnerability was discovered that allowed attackers to kick legitimate players and take over their session on cracked Minecraft servers.

### Attack Scenario (v1.0.0 - VULNERABLE)

```
1. Player "Dream" joins and authenticates
   ‚úÖ Dream is playing normally

2. Attacker joins with username "Dream" (different UUID)
   ‚ùå Minecraft kicks the original Dream
   ‚ùå Dream sees: "Logged in from another location"
   ‚ùå Attacker is now in the server as "Dream"

3. Plugin's security check runs
   ‚ö†Ô∏è TOO LATE - player already kicked
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Authentication completely bypassed
```

### Why This Was Critical

- ‚úó **Complete Security Bypass** - Authentication system was useless
- ‚úó **Session Takeover** - Attackers could impersonate any player
- ‚úó **No Warning** - Original player just got kicked
- ‚úó **Easy to Exploit** - Only needed to know a username
- ‚úó **Affects All Cracked Servers** - Minecraft default behavior

---

## ‚úÖ How It's Fixed (v1.0.1)

### New Protection Flow

```
1. Player "Dream" joins and authenticates
   ‚úÖ Dream is playing normally
   ‚úÖ Username "Dream" registered in security system

2. Attacker attempts to join with username "Dream"
   ‚úÖ Security check fires BEFORE Minecraft processes join
   ‚úÖ Plugin detects duplicate username
   ‚úÖ Attacker connection BLOCKED immediately
   ‚úÖ Original Dream never affected

3. Security Alerts Triggered
   ‚úÖ Dream receives in-game notification
   ‚úÖ Admins alerted
   ‚úÖ Discord webhook notification sent
   ‚úÖ Full audit trail logged
```

### Technical Implementation

**Pre-Login Event Handler:**
- Uses `AsyncPlayerPreLoginEvent` (fires BEFORE join)
- Checks username availability before connection
- Blocks attacker before Minecraft's duplicate handler
- Original player completely unaffected

**Username Tracking System:**
- `Map<String, UUID> activePlayerNames`
- Real-time tracking of online players
- Automatic cleanup on disconnect
- Handles edge cases (dirty disconnects, reloads)

---

---

## üéØ Who Should Update?

### ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT UPDATE REQUIRED

- **All servers** concerned about security
- **Public servers** with unknown players

### ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED UPDATE
- **Private servers** (lower risk but still recommended)
- **Premium servers** (redundant protection but no harm)
- **Development servers** (good practice)

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è NOT AFFECTED
- Servers not using MBTH Login Security
- Premium-only servers with online-mode=true (Mojang already prevents this)

---

## üîß Configuration

**No configuration needed!**

This is a critical security feature that is:
- ‚úÖ Always active
- ‚úÖ Automatic
- ‚úÖ Transparent to legitimate users
- ‚úÖ Zero configuration required

There is no option to disable this protection because:
- It's a fundamental security requirement
